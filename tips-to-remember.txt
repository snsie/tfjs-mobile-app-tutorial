1. Remember to git add/commit/push once you've been able to get something
to work and are at a good point or when you are calling it a day. Discuss
what could happen to their workspaces if they don't commit their code to github
(gitpod's time until forgetting workspaces)

2. remember to stop your workspace when you're done so that your monthly
usage quota won't be consumed while you're away (look up and link gitpod's
info on this) also mention the colored indicators on the left side of
each workspace instance to ensure that your workspace isn't open.

3. Point out the following gitpod features: (each side bar tool [left and right]),
(ctrl-shift-p and start typing theme, then you can choose different icon and
editor themes)(integration with vscode, mention built in vscode exts)

4. don't forget to talk bout the color tool
(create tab in https://color.adobe.com/explore) talk about how one of
the circles has a triangle at the base. that circle acts as an anchor.
the other circles will try to stay proportional to it, so set up the
other circles and then move the anchor around. Each circle has another
circle that will mirror it across the anchor circle. The mirroring
circle will maintain the angle, but not the length

5. remember to talk about import differences and destructuring

6. remember to talk about project structure (node_modules/src/package.json/index/app)

7. talk about casing, such as react and camelcasing
